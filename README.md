# SM-msvcrt-exports
Because I'm a complete maniac, I decided to write a SourcePawn include that contains stocks for <code>stdlib.h</code> functions located inside <code>msvcrt.dll</code>. You heard me right, *SourcePawn*.

I wrote this for fun and as a proof of concept. I would advise towards using extensions instead.
